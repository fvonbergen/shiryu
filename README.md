# Shiryu

Shiryu is a SDK for programming languages built in the form of a
[dagger.io](https://dagger.io/) module. It's focus is to standardize software
repositories structure and provide up to date commands for developer to
interact with the source code. Furthermore, those commands are the same that
run in the CI/CD pipeline.
